# BrickBreaker
![CI](https://github.com/confusedpotatoe/GroupProdject/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

BrickBreaker is a .NET 9 console remake of the classic paddle-and-bricks arcade game.  
This project includes Spectre.Console menus, a frame-based renderer, soundtrack playback via `NAudio`, and Supabase/PostgreSQL storage for players and leaderboards.

## Overview

- **Two gameplay modes** – log in for tracked scores or jump into Quick Play without an account.
- **State-machine UI** – Spectre.Console drives login, registration, leaderboard, and gameplay menus with progress indicators and dialogs.
- **Feature-complete engine** – multi-level brick layouts, a 60 FPS loop, paddle physics, multi-ball + paddle-extend power-ups, pause/music controls, and animated score pops.
- **Hosted leaderboard** – usernames, passwords, and timestamped scores are persisted to Supabase PostgreSQL when a connection string is configured.
- **Offline fallback** – if the connection string is missing, the app still runs with disabled stores and warns that auth/leaderboard actions are skipped.
- **Automated tests** – unit tests cover core auth + leaderboard flows using the abstractions in `BrickBreaker.Core`.

## Run the game locally

Prerequisites: .NET 9 SDK and (optionally) access to the Supabase/PostgreSQL instance referenced below.

```bash
# Restore all projects
dotnet restore

# Run the console UI (starts at the login/quick-play screen)
dotnet run --project BrickBreaker.UI

# Optional: build every project or run the unit tests
dotnet build BrickBreaker.sln
dotnet test BrickBreaker.sln
```

### Configure Supabase/PostgreSQL

The UI checks for a connection string at startup:

1. Update `BrickBreaker.Storage/Properties/appsettings.json` **or** set an environment variable named `Supabase` / `ConnectionString:Supabase`.
2. Provide a standard Npgsql connection string, for example:

```json
{
  "ConnectionString": {
    "Supabase": "Host=...;Port=5432;Database=...;Username=...;Password=...;Ssl Mode=Require;Trust Server Certificate=true"
  }
}
```

When present, registration/login, leaderboard submissions, per-user best scores, and the Top-10 table all use the hosted database. When absent, the UI clearly warns that those features are disabled but gameplay/Quick Play still works.

### Controls & tips

- `←` / `→` move the paddle, `Space` toggles pause.
- `N` skips to the next soundtrack track, `P` toggles music pause.
- Quick Play skips authentication and does not attempt to submit scores.

## Tests

Run `dotnet test BrickBreaker.sln` to execute the xUnit suite. Tests rely on the storage abstractions, so they run without real database access.
